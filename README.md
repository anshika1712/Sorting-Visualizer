# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! 
Nowadays sorting algorithms are widely used in computer software. Students of computer science start learning different algorithms in the first year of studies and sorting algorithms are among them. 
Since I faced the problems of sorting during the course of algorithm design in the first year of my studies, there is an understanding that the visual representation is a vital part of the studying process.
The main goal of the project was to create a program which would serve as a tool for understanding how most known sorting algorithms work. There was an attempt to make the best possible user experience.
